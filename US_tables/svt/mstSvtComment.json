Musashi's a guy in this world? And super-famous? Wow!\"\n\nAs you can see, this Musashi is a very casual person who doesn't put on airs.\nShe's not interested in victory nor honor, drinks way too much, is exceptionally greedy, and easily swayed by offers of free food.\nBut those who fight her all say this before they are defeated:\n\n...The flower at the apex of heaven is splendid in color.\nHer blade reaches the heights of true nothingness.",

She was born in the year 1584. \nHer father was an instructor of martial arts who served the Shinmen clan, the lords of Takayama castle. The Shinmen clan granted him the right to use the Shinmen name, and so he called himself Shinmen Munisai. Shinmen Munisai had a dojo that taught the use of the jitte in Miyamoto village in Yoshinosato, which became Musashi's homeland. For this reason, she calls herself Miyamoto Musashi.\nShe would later go on to leave behind many legends, especially during her twenties, when she fought many other warriors. To this day, these great duels are a staple of entertainment.\nHowever, the truth about most of the episodes that took place during the decade of her twenties is unknown, and many of them are believed to be fictional.",

As such, when she was summoned to this world as a Servant, she did a little digging in the history of the early 2000s and learned that high school girls were popular and considered to be highly beautiful during that time. These girls (at first glance) looked like they were having so much fun that Suzuka Gozen, enthralled by their way of life, immediately decided to adopt their style.

He taught Shinkageryu to the nobility and to his disciples, and he sent his disciples out as instructors of swordsmanship to powerful feudal lords.\nIn period piece shows and novels, he is often depicted as an extraordinary conspirator. This is likely because the Yagyu clan's social position was as high as a daimyou earning 12,500 koku of rice during the early Edo period, and it was highly unlikely that such position was earned through honest and innocent means.",

Munenori desperately tried to restrain Itakura Naizen-no-kami Shigemasa, who was ordered to lead a punitive attack. When Shogun Iemitsu asked him to explain his behavior, Munenori had only this to say: \"Religious battles are always crucial. Lord Shigemasa is sure to die in battle.\"\nThings unfolded just as Munenori predicted. Shigemasa, as a daimyou earning only 15,000 koku, lacked the power needed to lead the western daimyo, and so he struggled in the attack. After learning of this dire situation, Shogun Iemitsu sent out his chief retainer, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, as commander-in-chief. However, Shigemasa panicked when he found out, and he charged into enemy territory before Nobutsuna arrived, and there met his end.",

However, the Chiron summoned here regrets that he gave up his immortality, and wishes to regain it. He desires this not to become a god once again, nor because he wishes to live forever, but rather to reclaim the one thing he inherited from his parents.",

These conflicting saintly and villainous mindsets allow him to switch between two categories of alignment: Lawful and Chaotic.\n\nInnocent Monster (Foreign): A\nHe asserted that he was like unto a god, and by persecuting any nobility that had privilege and power, he was able to bring his authority to the absolute peak. Regarded by the people of Russia as the unchallenged tsar, the people in Western Europe cowered in fear and called him \"Ivan Grozny\" (Ivan the Fearsome).\nHere, having fused himself with a massive Demonic Beast that was itself considered the strongest of its time, he has become (or rather, been reduced to) a monstrous leviathan.

As Chiron was a good friend of Peleus, he was willing to take the boy on, and so Achilles began his training as a hero under the famed mentor, Chiron.\n\nA few years later, Achilles grew to be a proud young man. He eagerly joined in the Trojan war when recruited by the Achaeans.\n\nObviously, Achilles had no idea about the tragedy awaiting him in Troy.

However, King Ninus, an ambitious leader, was quite taken with Semiramis's beauty, and ultimately tore the couple apart. The separation greatly saddened Onnes, who killed himself. Semiramis had no choice but to accept King Ninus's affection.\nWhen war broke out, Semiramis's unorthodox tactical advice led her nation to victory. This led to King Ninus recognizing her talent, which prompted him to ask for her hand in marriage.\nHowever, on the day of the wedding banquet, King Ninus collapsed, writhing in agony, and died. The citizens whispered that Semiramis had poisoned the king to avenge her late husband.\nAnd so Semiramis became the Empress of Assyria, and commanded numerous expeditions and construction projects as regent for decades.\n\nSome legends say that she was murdered by her own son, while other legends say that after she ceded her power, she turned into a dove and flew away.",

However, by tapping into the many deeply rooted misconceptions in the popular belief surrounding them, she was able to secure them as her own Noble Phantasm.\n\nAs these Hanging Gardens are an object of empty vanity, the conditions for deploying them are strict.\nA specific amount of stones and soil taken from a specific ruin from a very specific time in a specific place in the Middle East must be gathered. Only after this is done, and a three-day ritual is conducted, will this Noble Phantasm be ready to function.\n\nAs its name suggests, it manifests as a giant floating fortress.\nAs long as she is within this fortress, all of Semiramis's stats increase dramatically. Her notoriety also increases to its highest possible level, and she gains a number of modifications that make her attacks much more advantageous to her as well.\n\nDuring a certain Holy Grail war, this garden was the site of a decisive battle. Its eleven defensive spells shot down a fleet of airplanes, but those defenses were ultimately breached by a holy maiden's banner and a flying knight's attack.",

This is because his ability stems from his synchronizing with another being, the Man in Grey, who is famously depicted as appearing before Mozart and commissioning him to write his Requiem in July of 1791. In battle, Salieri automatically dons this facade and behaves like an agent of slaughter.\n\nWildfire: B\nAs with any rumor, the legends of Mozart's assassination spread like wildfire. Avenger Salieri is perhaps the embodiment of all mankind's malice, slander, rumor, demagoguery, and horrible whispers, all of which serve to give him his power as well.\nThis skill not only instantly weakens the minds of his targets, but also functions as an intense mental attack. Unless his target has defenses on par with magecraft, he may drive them to suicide.",

    "comment": "Antonio Salieri was Amadeus Mozart's friend.\n\nNormally, he would not have been recorded on the Throne as an Anti-Hero. Though he lost his position at court, he was still a respected musician who took many other musicians and their children as disciples. His group of pupils included Süssmayr (Mozart's best disciple), Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (Mozart's son), and even Beethoven.\n\nHowever, around 1820, a rumor took hold around the world that Salieri had murdered Mozart. Though there was no truth to the rumor, people began envisioning a tragic story of a genius beloved by God and a talented prodigy jealous enough to kill. Even when an aged Salieri once told his pupil Moscheles that such rumors were \"malicious slander and nothing else,\" this was taken to be a confession of his crime. There were even rumors that Salieri, overcome with regret in his old age, went on to slash his own throat.",

However, he never allowed traditions to tie him down, instead always keeping his thoughts on the future.\nFor example, he learned the techniques of perspective drawing from Western art. He also blended snapshots of sudden movement with landscape painting, a technique that can be said to be the starting point of modern manga expression.\nShould he manifest in modern times, free of the shogunate's harsh restrictions, he would gladly spend every waking moment challenging himself to reach new artistic heights, whether through the medium of shunga, abstract art, digital art, or even performance art.",

    "comment": "In the distant past, in the age of the old gods, when the king of the gods was Enlil, not Marduk, there was a monstrous bird that the Akkadians called Anzû.\nIts Sumerian name was Imdugud.\nIt was a demon of storms, and a god who was a manifestation of strong winds and great clouds.\nThis monstrous bird served Enlil, but one day, it stole a great treasure while its master was bathing.\nAnd when it did, all creation was shrouded in darkness, and the world was threatened with destruction.\n\nThe great treasure that Anzû stole was the Tablet of Destinies, the ultimate symbol of royal authority over the world and its gods.\nAnd so, a creature like Anzû should never have been allowed to touch it.\nNot because it threatened the world with destruction, no, but because the royal authority would not answer to a being that did not have any right to it. \nAnd so the hero god Ninurta, son of Enlil, stole back the Tablet and the world was restored.\n\nAnd many years later, when the age of man was at its peak, the great treasure was brought to the golden city.\n\nWhat would the raging storm god Anzû think?\nWhat would one who could not seize royal authority think when the King of Heroes, a descendant of the gods, managed what it couldn't?",

    "comment": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...\n\n...The excerpt ends there.",

Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.\n\nIf there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself.

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of Hokusai's very last.\nAfter he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained.",

    "comment": "Valentine's chocolate from [servantName 503300].\n\nDo you have a moment, Master?\n\nI'd like to discuss something with you. Oh, I know. It's that time of year. I know very well why you are so restless...like you're waiting for someone.\nBut would you spare a few minutes to listen to what I, Medea, would like to say?\n\nWhat I want to discuss is my magecraft workshop.\nThey...they took it over! Auntie and Medea Lily!\n\nThey said they were going to convert it into a kitchen so they could make confections!\nAnd they were going to call it the Witches’ Kitchen, and it will only be open on Valentine’s Day!\nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches’ Kitchen is a bad idea. It’s like blatantly admitting that the food has special properties and ingredients!\nBut then Auntie said...\n“We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must create and use only objects of the highest quality...from confectionary-making tools to aprons! It’s like just like how one must have the proper feathers if one wishes to fly!”\n...She was quite enthusiastic about it.\nJust the fact that she’s spending time making sweets is taking away from her being a witch... Doesn’t she realize that she’s just an amateur pâtissier at this point?\nShe even tried to persuade me to join, but I politely declined.\n\nEh? You think that’s a shame?\nI already got involved because I lent them my aprons?\n\n...Your eye is keen as ever. I confess, it’s true. \nNever mind Lily, but Auntie...\nShe may not seem it, but she actually looks good no matter what she wears.\nSo I may have gone a bit overboard, working feverishly at my sewing machine.\nBut Auntie was a bit judgmental. She said that she never knew I had such homely talents! Ugh!\n\nAt any rate, I’m quite proud of how cute the little chef coats turned out. I can’t speak to the quality of the pastries, but I want you to at least pay attention to how wonderful their outfits are. \nSince it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will let my workshop go for now and just crash in some Saber’s room.\n\nThat’s why I’m here, Master. I have a few questions.\nAuntie’s been barging into my room, day and night, asking me so many things.\n\nHere are some of the things one of mythology’s greatest witches has been asking of me:\n“I want to know what Master’s favorite flavor is. Do you think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter be better?”\n“Are there any seasonings Master doesn’t like? You know, so I can balance things properly in the future..”\n“Now that I think about it, handmade confections are so lame. What do you think, Medea?”\n“If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do you think they’d have been? I hear there’s a hybrid brand of pigs called Tokyo ● from Japan. Sounds romantic, huh? It has ● in its name!”\nWho cares about breeds...\n“Hey Medea...I hear that Master is really traumatized by Valentine’s Day. Even if they eat our chocolates with a smile while we watch, I hear there’s vomiting back in Master’s room... Sounds like a joke, doesn’t it? Huh?”\n\n...So, there you have it. Phew.\nAnyway, it looks like Auntie’s a bit occupied right now and she can’t come over, so she sent me here on her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, not me.\nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don’t you agree, Master?\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she’s doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked? \nOh, it’s fine. You don’t need to be so formal and thank me...eh?\nI-I keep telling you! \nI-I-I’m Medea!!! Really! Honest!\nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I’m not lying!!!\nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!",

And three cats.\nA few years back, a young couple related to the aging shop owners traveled to this land.\nIn the beginning, there were many problems. There were even fights.\nBut the young couple worked hard and earnestly.\nTheir disappointments eventually gave way to hope and security.\n\nLunar New Year is coming once again.\nThe shop gets quite busy, making traditional confectionary that is essential to every Chinese person living abroad.\nAnd it was then that a certain order came in.\n\"Qíngrénjié. Qiǎokèlì.\" Valentine's Day. Chocolate.\nIt appears the order is for a crafted confectionary for Valentine's Day.\nIn the past, the shop owners made their famous confections and delivered them to large shops, but their weakened eyesight forced them to stop.\nThey wanted to refuse the order, but it came from an old friend.\nBut requesting a lotus flower confectionary for Valentine's Day is an odd choice, they thought.\n\nEvery morning, the shop owners visit the town shrine. While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple.\nThey are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child.\nA lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth.\nAfter some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.",

A great catastrophe that effectively abused human history.\n\nHis name is Beast I.\nHe is one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, and the Beast that possesses the principle of \"pity.\"\nThe arrogance of man taking pity on another and becoming disappointed.\nSuch is the bestial nature of Goetia.",

Kiara savors her victim's soul all while claiming she has done so in the name of providing salvation. It is the ultimate version of Charm, the power of absolute, implicit trust. By becoming a Beast, her powers have increased tremendously.\n\nWearing the crown of a Beast, or Mara, which is an obstacle for Buddhist practice, Kiara's beauty as the Demonic Bodhisattva shatters the sanity, reasoning, and morality of any who lay eyes on her. The moment an individual lays eyes on Kiara, they must make a sanity check—a SAN save, or \"Kiara save\"—to determine whether they retain their sanity and sense of self. If successful, vision, taste, hearing, smell, and sensation are all preserved. However, the moment they think of Kiara as beautiful, all is lost. When this happens, all sense of self is gone, and after a brief bout of dizziness, one's sense of equilibrium and reality simply evaporates. They are then doomed to become one of Kiara's many followers, already held within her palm.",

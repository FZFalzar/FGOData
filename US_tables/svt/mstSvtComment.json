She was born in the year 1584. \nHer father was an instructor of martial arts who served the Shinmen clan, the lords of Takayama castle. The Shinmen clan granted him the right to use the Shinmen name, and so he called himself Shinmen Munisai. Shinmen Munisai had a dojo that taught the use of the jitte in Miyamoto village in Yoshinosato, which became Musashi's homeland. For this reason, she calls herself Miyamoto Musashi.\nShe would later go on to leave behind many legends, especially during her twenties, when she fought many other warriors. To this day, these great duels are a staple of entertainment.\nHowever, the truth about most of the episodes that took place during the decade of her twenties is unknown, and many of them are believed to be fictional.",

She lives for love, and will die for love. On top of that, her pride in being regarded as a beauty has made her vain. As such, when she was summoned to this world as a Servant, she did a little digging in the history of the early 2000s and learned that high school girls were popular and considered to be highly beautiful during that time. These girls (at first glance) looked like they were having so much fun that Suzuka Gozen, enthralled by their way of life, immediately decided to adopt their style. While her style was born from a slight misunderstanding, Suzuka Gozen at least seems to like it.\n\n\"Since I've become a like, totes amazing high school girl, I should show hella pride in repping my fam.

The first is based on the legend of her being a savior from calamity, in which it is said that she saved a group of cavalrymen from an ambush by Native Americans. The other is based on her being called the \"woman who brings forth calamity,\" which purports that all her lovers were killed in battle. Some also suggest both are true.",

The use of weapons in a battle to the death should be avoided at all costs!\nAnd lucha is best for a battle of wits, too, yes!\"\n\nHer favorite luchador is La Mistico.\nAs the goddess of wind, and the goddess of Venus, when she saw luchadores (or if they're women, luchadoras) flying without wings, she was moved to tears, feeling she had seen the future.\nAfter that, her studious nature and self-control quickly helped make her a lucha master.\n\nShe boasts that she could put any god or beast into a headlock if she wanted, but in order to spread the gospel of jump-based lucha, she doesn't use any of the common lucha joint lock moves.",

Working hard or negotiating like some commoner simply will not do for such a sophisticated woman. No, that is beneath a celebrity of her caliber. \n\nBut raising funds by gathering jewelry, famous paintings, necklaces, and other such valuable treasures...? Yes, that sounds just perfect.

After gaining his lord's trust, Chen Gong defected, joining Lu Bu, who was widely considered to be a terrible menace to China during this turbulent time. Together, they fought Cao Cao for dominance of the land.\n\nAfter multiple defeats, both Chen Gong and Lu Bu died at the city of Xiapi. It was said that their trials and executions were personally overseen by Cao Cao.",

Mara's attempts to obstruct Buddha's enlightenment and Kama's interruption of Shiva's meditation have resulted in this god being known as one with a love of tempting the faithful.\n\nKama/Mara can be said to be a god who embodies both the best and worst of love.",

Feeling responsible, she decided to confide with the shady mage (Merlin) she befriended in the past.\n\n...At least, Musashi never actually tells that story.\nIn order to conceal the fact that she is the mysterious demon that may lead the West to destruction, she tries desperately to act normally while hoping to get everything squared away without anyone being the wiser.\nShe doesn't want anyone learning of her mistake because, well, she doesn't want to \"get scolded by Master.

In the myth, it is said that the gods sought the nectar of immortality, the Amrita, in order to survive on the desolate surface land. To create the Amrita, the ocean of milk (Kshirasāgara) surrounding the world needed to be churned. The gods formed an alliance with their enemy Asuras, and began churning the ocean of milk, using Mount Mandara as the axis, and created many life-forms and elixirs. Airāvata is the name of one of the giant elephants that was created from the ocean of milk during that process.\n\nThe Kingprotea that has been summoned for a limited time in Chaldea is perpetually suppressed. This is due to the world's repressive power, set by the limitations of the physical world, which do not exist in the cyber world.\n\nThis Noble Phantasm is a reality marble that temporarily throws off this suppression to allow Protea to revert to her true size. Protea, as a giant so large that no normal human can see her entirely, flails her arms and legs to annihilate the enemy. In the original, she herself was treated as a Noble Phantasm, but she was able to manifest her own Noble Phantasm in the cyber world in exchange for her Spirit Origin's rank decreasing.",

The terms \"cute\" and \"bride\" aren't mutually exclusive to her. Rather, she thinks that cuteness is a given when one becomes a bride. It's strange to think that she doesn't associate cuteness with maintaining normal human size...",

When she reaches maximum level, her specs are increased to enable further level cap growth. This can be repeated infinitely, and is also called infinite growth. She is a cosmically massive catastrophe capable of destroying planets, but the larger she grows, the more she loses her intellect and complex function. Thus, her normal intellectual form would self-destruct from the inability to tolerate this skill.\nThis skill used to be a nonstandard rank EX, but its rank has downgraded since Chaldea's summoning system was unable to replicate it. Growth begins the moment it is used, and the value caps that are increased are permanent until Infantile Regression is used.\n\nInfantile Regression: C\nThe shackle BB placed upon Kingprotea. A safety device put in place to restrain her infinite growth. It returns her to her original size and stats, and resets her enlarged ego.

    "comment": "The Alter Ego of yearning.\nWhen Kiara's SE.RA.PH evolved within the Abyssal Cyber City, she was recreated as something that accompanied SE.RA.PH.\n(*Kiara deliberately extracted Meltryllis and Passionlip to use and synchronize with herself, while Kingprotea's recreation was not something Kiara intended.)\n\nUnder normal circumstances, she would never have been found, and would have vanished like a bubble along with SE.RA.PH Kiara without ever meeting a single soul.\n\nBut since becoming a Servant, she waits for Master's orders...or rather, she grows to love receiving orders. This is because she has no self-confidence, and so she takes joy in believing that being ordered around is the same as being loved. Protea is constantly ashamed of herself, since she is aware that she is a waste byproduct.\n\nShe has no interest in the outside world nor other humans, and simply seeks for Master's love. Calling it an innocent advance or blind devotion sounds nice and all, but in reality, it's a dangerous relationship, like walking a tightrope. Protea does not love Master because she has feelings for them, but simply because Master loves her, which shows that Protea only knows love without understanding true feelings of endearment and closeness. Should Master's affection run out, she will cease to feel love, and she will quickly become unsatisfied. Should that ever happen, Protea won't be able to endure her thirst for love, and will devour Master.\n\nUltimately, Protea is just like any of the other Alter Egos, born with a twisted sense of self. She will obediently follow Master's orders, but her submission is not total. In order for that to happen, Masters who form a contract with Kingprotea will need to further develop her mental state and essence as a being. This is also necessary for Masters to be able to escape Protea's inexhaustible, deep yearning. She will need to learn that her incessant coveting only devours and exhausts her targets, and that a healthy relationship means both parties partake of mutual love for one another.",

It is older than ancient space, and the goddess Ashtart had a cult of worship within prehistorical ancient civilizations, long before mammals existed on Earth.\nThese humans did not carry the notion of faith at that time, and so they considered goddesses simply to be a term for a sector that enabled life to exist.\nWhether the belief itself or its practices took shape to become a concept is unclear. Either way, Ishtar/Ashtart became a galaxy taking the form of a human. Normally she would not be someone who could be handled by humans, nor would she have ever become a Servant.\n\nBut when Professor Tokiomi coincidently discovered the spiritual core of the goddess, he raised her as the \"good half.\" Even after his death, he left his daughter in the hands of a trusted assistant.\n\"I may only be able to teach the textbook definition of what's good, but being the smart girl that she is, Space Ishtar's likely to see through the hypocrisy of the teachings, and she may lose interest in good and ultimately fall to the side of evil if I'm not there for her.\nHowever, by being close to Jane, who is genuinely good without being two-faced and is able to get to the truth of things (despite paying the price of calling forth destruction and chaos), Space Ishtar may realize that good and evil are not always two sides of the same coin.

She was just a sensitive girl of a tender age who never once thought to be suspicious of others.\n\nThe Puritans placed value on earthly hardships, and they crossed the Atlantic ocean to flee the oppression of the power hungry church, and ended up in the New World. However, others eventually caught up to and cornered them. Their \"protest\" was soon directed to their neighbors and those nearby.\n\nIn answer to what they saw as the moral decay of the world around them, the Puritans embraced the steadfast belief that one must restrain oneself, which became their way of monitoring one another. The difficult colonial life rife with war and pillaging soon created a mentality of suspicion and selfishness.\nHysteria gripped the people, and they sought to lay the blame at witches' feet. They began to believe that their misfortunate was the work of the devil himself.\n\nThe gates of the atrocious witch trials soon opened with the emergence of witches in Salem. This tumultuous situation became the keyhole while the girl became the key that reflected the sentiments of the people. If both sides are fundamentally necessary for the other to exist, which side is truly to blame?",

    "comment": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...\n\n...The excerpt ends there.",

Since then, Nezha always carried it with her.\n\nThe weapon can expand and contract at will. They are usually worn around the wrist as a pair of bracelets, but they quickly turn into a pair of circular blades the moment they leave the body. Nezha uses this weapon like a semi-autonomous drone.\nWhen she throws them up in the air and shouts \"Jí (speed)!\" the Rings shoot towards the enemy. When she shouts \"Tíng (stay)!\" they stop in mid-air, and they return to her hand when she shouts \"Lái (come)!\"\n\nBut there was a time when Nezha didn't carry the Universe Rings.\nThey were taken from her in the battle against Lady Rock, and later retrieved by Taiyi Zhenren, who kept them temporarily.\nFrom the time of Nezha's suicide to save her human parents and atone for her sins until her rebirth, they were out of her possession.\nTo Nezha, this Baobei is closely associated with humiliating and regrettable memories. Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.\n\nIf there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself. And it would also represent a vow that she will always resurrect and come back to the holder, no matter what.",

As Hokusai passed away in the same year at the age of ninety, this painting is often considered one of Hokusai's very last.\nAfter he completed the \"Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji\" at age seventy, his passion for art didn't fade as he continued to create. He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained.",

They all asked me to do it because they said I was the only one who could do it, and so I wielded my sword believing that.\n\nThey all hailed me as the expert of divine punishment and threw piles of money at me, and I was ecstatic. Anyone who made fun of me before now cowered in fear and opened up the road for me whenever I passed by. That felt good. My sky was nice and clear.\n\nBut eventually, the same folks started to look at me as if I were a dog. They talked about the state of the nation and other complicated stuff to keep me out of the loop. I didn't like that one bit. My sky was nice and clear, but it had started to cloud.\n\nEventually I was wandering around the capital all alone. I had no money and I was hungry. Even though my sky was still clear, I didn't want to do anything. I didn't care anymore.\n\nI don't know how and why things ended up like this. I don't know where I made any mistakes. I'm not so smart, so I must've messed up somewhere. No, I must not have made any mistakes from the start. I know I wasn't wrong when I was playing by the riverbed with my mates back in the day.\n\nIt's a splendid sky...a sky so perfectly clear.",

Then he simply climbed back down the mountain.\n\nWhen he said this so casually, like it was nothing, I started to think of it that way too. I forgot all about those wretched humans who sealed me away.\n\nAs I was thinking about all that, the face of that silly human flashed across my mind and it suddenly became rather unforgettable to me.

Oh yes, that's right, it's the same chapter actualized by my Noble Phantasm.\n\nI seem to be doing this unconsciously, but I must really like this chapter... \n\nOr it could be...that my very soul is engraved in this chapter.\n\nHehe... What do you think, Master?",

Yet they are not all painful memories. Those sparkling, dazzling, bustling, fun times spent in a foreign land were but a fleeting summer memory to me. The time I fought against a mysterious demonic king, Master and I (where I was their martial arts master) formed a wonderful united front, the secret technique finally coming into its own after evading many life-threatening crises, a watermelon that exploded and made a mess from a game of watermelon splitting, overcooked yet still delicious yakisoba, shaved ice that dyed the tongue all blue... Oh, I'm sorry, I digress.\n\nThat's right. No words need to be exchanged between Master and I. Now, speaking as your master in martial arts, you must inherit my legacy that is this ultimate technique to become a true samurai who will tear through the Milky Way.\n\n...To go beyond the cloudless blue sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nEh?

Heh...curious as to why?\nWell, it's the name of one of the girls who entertained me in the past.\nHer cute face got all twisted up, and her screams echoed like a scene from an opera...\nJust thinking about it makes me shiver with excitement.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you jealous.\nDon't worry. There may be an opportunity for me to change the car's name to your own... That is, if you can entertain me more than her...or rather, if you become one of my favorites...\n\nAnd that's why you'll be showing me how cute you are tonight.\nEven if you're scared, I won't let you close your eyes. Open your eyes properly and indulge yourself in my illusion and speed.\nAre you ready? I'm going to floor it!\"",

Even with his body rotted away and accepting the fact that his once envisioned ideal would not be possible, the king headed out into the deadly battle.\n\nHe does so to lead the people...to ask the people once again what the meaning of living even is.",

    "comment": "Valentine's chocolate from [servantName 503300].\n\nDo you have a moment, Master?\n\nI'd like to discuss something with you. Oh, I know. It's that time of year. I know very well why you are so restless...like you're waiting for someone.\nBut would you spare a few minutes to listen to what I, Medea, would like to say?\n\nWhat I want to discuss is my magecraft workshop.\nThey...they took it over! Auntie and Medea Lily!\n\nThey said they were going to convert it into a kitchen so they could make confections!\nAnd they were going to call it the Witches’ Kitchen, and it will only be open on Valentine’s Day!\nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches’ Kitchen is a bad idea. It’s like blatantly admitting that the food has special properties and ingredients!\nBut then Auntie said...\n“We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must create and use only objects of the highest quality...from confectionary-making tools to aprons! It’s like just like how one must have the proper feathers if one wishes to fly!”\n...She was quite enthusiastic about it.\nJust the fact that she’s spending time making sweets is taking away from her being a witch... Doesn’t she realize that she’s just an amateur pâtissier at this point?\nShe even tried to persuade me to join, but I politely declined.\n\nEh? You think that’s a shame?\nI already got involved because I lent them my aprons?\n\n...Your eye is keen as ever. I confess, it’s true. \nNever mind Lily, but Auntie...\nShe may not seem it, but she actually looks good no matter what she wears.\nSo I may have gone a bit overboard, working feverishly at my sewing machine.\nBut Auntie was a bit judgmental. She said that she never knew I had such homely talents! Ugh!\n\nAt any rate, I’m quite proud of how cute the little chef coats turned out. I can’t speak to the quality of the pastries, but I want you to at least pay attention to how wonderful their outfits are. \nSince it seems I have no choice, I suppose I will let my workshop go for now and just crash in some Saber’s room.\n\nThat’s why I’m here, Master. I have a few questions.\nAuntie’s been barging into my room, day and night, asking me so many things.\n\nHere are some of the things one of mythology’s greatest witches has been asking of me:\n“I want to know what Master’s favorite flavor is. Do you think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter be better?”\n“Are there any seasonings Master doesn’t like? You know, so I can balance things properly in the future..”\n“Now that I think about it, handmade confections are so lame. What do you think, Medea?”\n“If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do you think they’d have been? I hear there’s a hybrid brand of pigs called Tokyo ● from Japan. Sounds romantic, huh? It has ● in its name!”\nWho cares about breeds...\n“Hey Medea...I hear that Master is really traumatized by Valentine’s Day. Even if they eat our chocolates with a smile while we watch, I hear there’s vomiting back in Master’s room... Sounds like a joke, doesn’t it? Huh?”\n\n...So, there you have it. Phew.\nAnyway, it looks like Auntie’s a bit occupied right now and she can’t come over, so she sent me here on her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, not me.\nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don’t you agree, Master?\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she’s doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked? \nOh, it’s fine. You don’t need to be so formal and thank me...eh?\nI-I keep telling you! \nI-I-I’m Medea!!! Really! Honest!\nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I’m not lying!!!\nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!",

While praying, they recalled the discussion with the young couple.\nThey are with child, and they want the aging couple to think of a name for their unborn child.\nA lotus flower is a symbol of children and a prayer for safe childbirth.\nAfter some thought, the shop owners decide to accept the order.",

It is a story of an ordinary main character who deepens his bond with various heroines.\n\nThe first heroine is able to communicate with spirits, and knew the main character long before the main character knew her. When they are reunited a few years later, it appears he forgot the important promise made with the heroine. \"Hnngh. It feels like I'd be a loser if I reminded him of my promise...so I'll make the spirits jog his memory!\" Oh, also, within just two days of their reunion, there was a whole scare about the main character having to suddenly move away.\n\nThe second heroine is a senpai-next-door sort of heroine who had always taken good care of the main character. She could be both stern and sweet. The way she embraces the main character is more akin to how a big sister or mother might do so. But, be warned that she can be more frightening than an oni when angered. \"Oh my, look how dirty you are. Would you like me to give you a bath while I rubby-rub you all clean like we did back in the day?\"\n\nThe third heroine is...well, she's a stalker who fell in love with the main character at first sight after he came into her home to shelter from the rain. Their first words were exchanged when the main character peeked under his bed in the middle of the night, sensing something strange. \"I love you! Kya! I said it! When should we sign our marriage certificate?\"\n\nAt their school, there's an urban legend that says that anyone who summons the goddess of love under the legendary tree will find the love they desire. But obviously, the heroines vying for the affection of the main character surely will not let their rivals get ahead. And so, the goddess who flirts with the bear remains up in the heavens, while the great war for love rages down on the surface...",

By becoming a Beast, her powers have increased tremendously.\n\nWearing the crown of a Beast, or Mara, which is an obstacle for Buddhist practice, Kiara's beauty as the Demonic Bodhisattva shatters the sanity, reasoning, and morality of any who lay eyes on her. The moment an individual lays eyes on Kiara, they must make a sanity check—a SAN save, or \"Kiara save\"—to determine whether they retain their sanity and sense of self. If successful, vision, taste, hearing, smell, and sensation are all preserved. However, the moment they think of Kiara as beautiful, all is lost. When this happens, all sense of self is gone, and after a brief bout of dizziness, one's sense of equilibrium and reality simply evaporates.
